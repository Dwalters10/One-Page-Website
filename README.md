# One-Page-Website
 One page website assignment

update page with lightbox.  image gallery working fine except small issu with thumbnails on bottom overlapping, I ahve been currently unable to find the solution to issue, suspect it might be the size of the thumbnails that are causing the issue, due to time constraints I must submit the project, I will revisit and find solution when time permits. other than this is functional.
